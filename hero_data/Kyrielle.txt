Skill 2, Basic Attack, Skill 1, Passive

--- TIPS/IMPORTANT INFO ---
Overall not that great of a hero at lower tiers. Once you get her to T2-T6 she becomes a little bit more of a viable PvP unit. T2 gives her single targert Skill 1 a recast on kill and Skill 2 is a AOE Paralysis. The good thing about this unit is at T6 you dont have to worry about queueing any skills in PvP since she becomes immune to CC. This hero also scales all attack with speed making it a good speed stick as well as good CC.
