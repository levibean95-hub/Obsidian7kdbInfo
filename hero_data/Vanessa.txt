--- SKILL ENHANCE PRIORITY ---

Skill 1, Skill 2, Passive (ALL GOOD)

--- TIPS/IMPORTANT INFO ---

Sandstorm sits at (%70-%80) chance to inflict a skill cooldown increase. This is the highest "CC" ability in the game and Spellweaver set increases probability to (%80-%90). Skill cooldown increase in PvP is an amazing opener as landing any can mess up the enemies queued skills. This unit is very good for magic team compositions and can even be used in some physical teams since her passive gives (%20-%24) defense down.
