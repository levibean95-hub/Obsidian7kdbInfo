--- SKILL ENHANCE PRIORITY ---
S1 > Passive

--- TIPS/IMPORTANT INFO ---
Can use for power up dungeons before u have strong shane/Espada
Passive phys vulnerability + S1 upgrade for defense down is a powerful combo to make your hitters like Kyle go crazy
Weakness hit set is playable because she will more often target low hp targets with her execute
Dont underestimate the burn, it does alot of damage
