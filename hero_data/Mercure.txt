--- SKILL ENHANCE PRIORITY ---
All good but prio passive

--- TIPS/IMPORTANT INFO ---
Really good in most content. Magic reflux spreads a lot faster when u get him T2 and T6, as well as with spellweaver set.
Strong with platin in arena cause platin can solo tank and does a lot of aoe damage proccing magic reflux often
Dont even think about playing him without 3 mages on the team
Premier nightmare and tower pusher
